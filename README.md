# gwt-react-playground

A simple project to experiment with gwt-react

## TODO

* Publish to realityforge
* Integrate Arez
* Develop React-Arez extension

* Consider using annotations and generator to generate components
* Add ReactConfig ala ArezConfig so some stuff is optimized out in production.
* Add mechanism for exporting methods with useful displayNames in props
* Overload React methods so can accept arrays
* Move to Arez browser config
