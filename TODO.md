## TODO

### Next Release

* Remove `@State` and all related infrastructure.
  - This includes the appropriate parameters to all the lifecycle methods.
  - Also add hook method `componentDidUpdate()` with no parameters.
  - remove `arez.Procedure` or at least make it package access.

* Add `@OnPropChanged` that is invoked for each prop whenever they change values. Change replicant to use this.
  Will probably need to adapt `notifyOnObservablePropChanges()` to handle this.

* Fix `notifyOnObservablePropChanges()` so that it gracefully handles scenario where primitives are used in props
  - same fix as in replicant

### Next Next Release

* Collections returned from props should be made immutable.

* Consider adding a `type=STATELESS|PURE|STATEFUL|AREZ|AUTODETECT` to component. `STATELESS` would be inlined into
  caller without a component in production mode, `PURE` would have SCU automagically created assuming
  `Object.equals()`, `STATEFUL` = can use fields, `@Callback` methods. `AREZ` = `STATELESS` + can use `@Observable`,
  `@Computed`, `@Memoize`, `@Observed`. `AUTODETECT` will be `STATELESS` if no fields, `@Callback` methods,
  lifecycle methods, `@State` methods or `@Observed`/`@Computed` annotated methods and no prop is an arez component.
  `AUTODETECT` will be `PURE` if it satisfies `STATELESS` and all props are primitives or the processor knows shallow
   comparison works. It will be `AREZ` if has an arez annotation and/or ant props are arez components. Otherwise it is
   `STATEFUL`. For `STATELESS|PURE` components we would need to add an invariant check to ensure it is not invoked
   out of turn. When inlining the `build()` method in builder will access static singleton instance of component, set
   props and call render.

* Make it possible to specify an arez component that may not always read arez state ... somehow

* Add `@DisposeOnUnmount` which is functionally equivalent to `@CascadeDispose` but available on normal react components

* Generate an error if a cached `@Callback` field is passed to a DOM element. It is ultimately useless.

* Generate an error if a cached `@Callback` field is passed to a `STATELESS` component. It is ultimately useless.

* Generate a compile error if public methods and protected in actual react class .. unless they implement an interface?

* Introduce `TreeLocal` component which is effectively context

* Consider marking callbacks with marker type `<T extends MouseEventHandler & Serializable>` and mandate the usage
  of such in pure components?

### Very High Priority

* Add helper to autoload js assets

* Make the name of the assets based off the version of the underlying react library. i.e. Name them `react-16.5.0.js`
  rather than `react.js` so cache is never in conflict.

* Consider whether can turn off remove `@Callback` annotation altogether.
- It seems we probably want to turn off `@Action` wrapping for `@Callback`? Unless (see next point)
- EventHandlers in Arez based components should somehow detect Arez.isSchedulerPaused() and persist any event and
  schedule onceoff autorun that will be re-run when scheduler is enabled. (The autorun will need to dispose itself
  and will need to be marked as runImmediately=false)
_ EventHandlers should probably start scopes for profiler by default with the ability to optionally disable

* Start to add javascript tests - starting with braincheck ala
  https://github.com/google/jsinterop-base/commit/7d0380758b6bef74bd947e284521619b6826346f

* Add `Observer` react component that is just an arez component that performs change tracking for render prop.

* Migrate to React 16.5.0 features
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1650-september-5-2018
  - Consider generating "Interaction tracking with React" - https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/8de925562903afd2e7a12554adcdda16
  - https://elijahmanor.com/react-devtools-profiler/
  - Consider adding `react-dom/profiling` "production" javascript profiler - may need to wait for umd variant of
    production js produced. - https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13634

* Migrate to React 16.4.0 features - See https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/05/23/react-v-16-4.html
  - Pointer Events

* Move to React 16.3.0 - See https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html
  - Implement `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` lifecycle method.
  - Add `snapshot` parameter to `componentDidUpdate`

### High Priorities

* Add ability to `@Prop` to add enhancers to builder.

* Consider separating Arez react component infrastructure into a mixin with default methods.

### Medium Priorities

* Figure out a way to define dom factories in java that are optimized away in production such that
  `DOM.h1().className('foo').tabIndex(3).children("Hello",DOM.span().className('red').children('World'))`
  compiles to `React.createElement('h1', {className: 'foo', tabIndex:3},["Hello",React.createElement('span',{className: 'red'},['World'])])`
  Maybe judicious use of `@ForceInline`? `.children` or `.build` closing the element. Perhaps these
  element factories can be built by looking at html spec and auto-generating?
  - https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react/index.d.ts
  - https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp
  - Consider typed refs that bind to underlying Elemental2 element.

### Low Priorities

* Port transition code ala
  - https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group
  - https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/
  or maybe https://react-move.js.org/

* In base class have configuration that warns on re-renders that produced duplicate values.

* build in https://github.com/maicki/why-did-you-update

* Consider adopting variable arguments ala https://fblitho.com/docs/props#variable-arguments

* HackerNews clone
  - https://hnpwa.com/
  - https://github.com/rwieruch/react-mobx-hackernews
  - https://github.com/clintonwoo/hackernews-react-graphql

#### Compiler optimizations

(Sourced from [ReactJS Changelog](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html#compiler-optimizations))
Implement these compiler optimizations sourced from Babel 5.8.24 and newer. Both of these transforms should be enabled
only in production (e.g., just before minifying your code) because although they improve runtime performance, they make
warning messages more cryptic and skip important checks that happen in development mode, including propTypes.

* Inlining React elements: The optimisation.react.inlineElements transform converts JSX elements to object literals
  like {type: 'div', props: ...} instead of calls to React.createElement.
* Constant hoisting for React elements: The optimisation.react.constantElements transform hoists element creation to
  the top level for subtrees that are fully static, which reduces calls to React.createElement and the resulting
  allocations. More importantly, it tells React that the subtree hasnâ€™t changed so React can completely skip it
  when reconciling.

* Consider moving factories to creating elements directly ie.
  https://github.com/kay-is/react-from-zero/blob/master/00-object-elements.html

* Synthesize Fragments - https://github.com/kay-is/react-from-zero/blob/master/04-components.html

#### Documentation

* Add graph reflecting size of TodoMVC over time

* Reorganize documentation using the following sites as inspiration.
  - Reason React - https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/
  - VueGWT - https://axellience.github.io/vue-gwt/introduction/
  - https://fblitho.com/

* Incorporate many of the ideas of Litho. Inadvertantly we seem to have created something that looks similar with
  slight differences. Probably because both libraries try to use idiomatic java patterns with a react-like engine.

* Add lifecycle image from https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509 and credit author

* Or most excellent image from https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-react16-is-a-blessing-to-react-developers-31433bfc210a

* Create a jsbin-alike to display GWT code
  - https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin
  - http://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,console,output

* Prepare a screencast for React4j+Arez.
