 * A base class for all Arez enabled components. This class makes the component

 * entities accessed within the scope of the render method are changed.
 *
 * <p>To achieve this goal, the props and state of the component are converted into
 * observable properties. This of course means they must be accessed within the scope
 * of an Arez transaction. (Typically this means it needs to be accessed within the
 * scope of a {@link Action} annotated method or within the scope of the render method.</p>
