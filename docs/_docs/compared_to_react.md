React4j is based on [React](https://reactjs.org) so it is natural to ask how they compare and
what are the differences between the two libraries. React4j is written in Java rather than
javascript so there are some features thar just don't make sense to implement in a Java
environment. There are also some features of React that exist for legacy reasons so are not
implemented
