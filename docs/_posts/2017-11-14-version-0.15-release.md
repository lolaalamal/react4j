[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/react4j/compare/v0.14...v0.15)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[processor\]** Initial support added for React's `"defaultProps"` added. The component defines a static,
  non-private methods named `getInitialProps()` on the component class. This method is invoked when the component
  constructor is created and the results are defined as the default properties.

##### Fixed
* Make sure the `NativeComponent.render()` method is public otherwise the GWT compiler get's confused and
  generates self-recursive method for `render()`.
