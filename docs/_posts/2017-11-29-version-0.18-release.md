[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.17...v0.18)

Changes in this release:

##### Changed
* Upgrade Arez to version 0.30.
* **\[processor\]** Remove the direct dependency on the `javax.annotation.Nonnull` and
  `javax.annotation.Nullable` annotations from the `react4j-processor` artifact.
* **\[processor\]** Shade the processor dependencies so that the only jar required during annotation processing
  is the annotation processor jar. This eliminates the possibility of processorpath conflicts causing issues in
  the future.
