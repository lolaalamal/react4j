[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.20...v0.21)

Changes in this release:

##### Changed
* **\[core\]** Upgrade to react 16.2.0.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Remove `Component.isComponentBound()` method as usage is an indication that there is a bug or
  failure in the API that should be removed.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Fix the nullability annotations on parameters to the `NativeAdapterComponent` constructor and
  cascade the fix to subclasses generated by the annotation processor.
* **\[core\]** Fix javadocs errors in the `NativeAdapterComponent` class.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Change the `Component.componentDidConstruct()` lifecycle method to accept two parameters
  `props` and `context`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Remove `NativeComponent.setState(State)` method as `NativeComponent.setState(SetStateCallback)`
  is a better alternative.
* **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version 0.33.
* **\[arez\]** Improve the javadocs on the `ReactArezComponent` class.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Change `props()` and `state()` methods in the `ReactArezComponent` class to be observable
  properties. This reverts an earlier change made in v0.07 as it was found that a lot of downstream code made
  the assumption that they are observable.
