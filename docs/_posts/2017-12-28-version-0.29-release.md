[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.28...v0.29)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Ensure that the generated subclasses of `ReactArezComponent` set the
  `deferSchedule` parameter on the `@ArezComponent`. This fixes bug where `@Autorun` annotated
  methods are running prior to injection completing.

##### Changed
* **\[docs\]** Use relative paths where possible for release posts on website.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Stop subclasses of `ReactArezComponent` from using component state and instead fail
  with an invariant that suggests using observable Arez state.
