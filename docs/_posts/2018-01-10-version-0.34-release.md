[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.33...v0.34)

Changes in this release:

##### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.40`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename the `ReactComponent.Feature` constants to improve clarity;
  - `TRUE` renamed to `ENABLE`
  - `FALSE` renamed to `DISABLE`
  - `IF_DETECTED` renamed to `AUTODETECT`
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** The contents of the `arez` state value in `ReactArezComponent` components has
  changed to a frozen map between the Arez node name and the value returned by the Arez spy
  property introspector. This improves the ability to introspect Arez components until an
  appropriate DevTool is put in place.
