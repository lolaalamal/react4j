React4j is an opinionated abstraction on top of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) that allows you to use Java
to build a web application using the React component model. The [React component model](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
defines components that are passed `props` by their container, manage their own `state` and can be composed
to make complex UIs.

React4j uses GWT 2.8+ to compile the Java code to Javascript and aims to migrate to J2CL and/or GWT 3.x as
soon it is released.
