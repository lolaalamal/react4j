React4j is a relatively new toolkit but there are some other resources and related projects.
This list will hopefully grap over time. Feel free to submit a pull request to add new projects
to this page.

* [arez](https://github.com/arez/arez) Arez is a simple, efficient and scalable state management library
  powered by a transparent functional reactive programming core. It is the state management library that
  has the best support in the react4j library.

* [react-widget](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-widget) The library provides a GWT widget that
  renders a React4j element. This project has been archived as there is no desire to continue supporting
  this architecture although it should still be possible.
* [react-windowportal](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-windowportal) The library provides a portal that
  renders into a Window.
