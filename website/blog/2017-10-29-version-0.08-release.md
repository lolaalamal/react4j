[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.07...v0.08)

Changes in this release:

##### Changed
* Upgrade to Arez 0.22.
* Use Arez's `@ContextRef` annotation to get access to `ArezContext` rather than relying on custom code
  in `ReactArezComponent`.
* Use Arez's `@ObserverRef` annotation to get access to the `Observer` for render rather than relying on
  custom code in `ReactArezComponent`.
* ðŸ’¥ Changed the access modifier on the `TYPE` field in the enhanced component class from public to private.
  Creation of `ReactElement` instances is now done by invoking the factory methods named `_create` that
  have been added to the enhanced component class.
