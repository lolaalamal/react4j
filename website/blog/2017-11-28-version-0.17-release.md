[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.16...v0.17)

Changes in this release:

##### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Changed the naming convention of the classes generated from nested static classes.
  Previously the name components were separated by a `$` but this is the same convention that is used by
  nested classes and thus a nested class could have aname collision with a generated class. Instead the
  `_` character has been used to separate name components.
* **\[processor\]** Remove direct dependency on `elemental.core` package from `processor` artifact.
* **\[processor\]** Remove direct dependency on `jsinterop.*` packages from `processor` artifact.
* **\[processor\]** Remove direct dependency on `react4j.annotations` and `react4j.core` packages
  from `processor` artifact.
* **\[processor\]** Upgrade the version of javapoet to 1.8.0.
* Upgrade Arez to version 0.27.
