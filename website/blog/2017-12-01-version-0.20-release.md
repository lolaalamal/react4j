[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.19...v0.20)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[arez\]** Enhance `ReactArezComponent` so that autoruns are not scheduled when the component is created but are
  instead scheduled after the `componentDidConstruct` lifecycle method was invoked. This ensures that `@Autorun`
  methods are not invoked when the component is invalid (i.e. when the native component has not been attached or
  when the `componentDidConstruct` method has yet to complete.)

##### Changed
* **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version 0.32.
* Upgrade Buildr to version 1.5.4.
* **\[processor\]** Detect the presence of the `@Inject` annotation on fields or methods of classes annotated with
  `@ReactComponent`. If detected then ensure that the enhanced component either; sets the `inject = true` parameter
  on the `@ArezComponent` annotation for arez components or defines a default constructor with an `@Inject` annotation
  for non-arez components. This is the first step to enabling integration of React4j components with injection
  frameworks such as Dagger2 or Google GIN.
