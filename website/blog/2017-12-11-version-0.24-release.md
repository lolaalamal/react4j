[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.23...v0.24)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Fixed bug where `ReactArezComponent.scheduleStateUpdate()` could result in a call to
  `Component.forceUpdate()` within the context of state updater. This would trigger an invariant failure
  within ReactJs code.

##### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Add a parameter `onStateUpdateComplete` to `Component.scheduleStateUpdate(...)` that is
  invoked by the react runtime after the state update has completed. Add additional overloaded variants of
  `Component.scheduleStateUpdate(...)` where the call back is not present. This had the impact of changing
  the variant without the `onStateUpdateComplete` parameter to be a final method invocation.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Remove the remaining `Component.renderAs*` methods as they do not provide significant benefit
  relative to cost now that the `ReactNode` class has been introduced.
