[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.26...v0.27)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[docs\]** Add initial documentation about integrating React4j components into dependency injection
  frameworks such as [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger).
* **\[docs\]** Add expected "Code of Conduct" documentation.

##### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Changed the name of the nested type within dagger specific injection factory from
  `MyComponentDaggerFactory.DaggerComponent` to `MyComponentDaggerFactory.DaggerSubcomponent`. This
  is so that the name of class reflects the behaviour of the class.
* Change the publish task so that it only publishes tag as an artifact if the tag is on the master branch.
