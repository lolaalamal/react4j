[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.29...v0.30)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Fix the generated class so that they generate an invariant failure if you attempt
  to instantiate a React4j component that requires dependency injection without correctly configuring the
  dependency injection provider. This means that during development mode a meaningful error message will
  be generated but the invariant check will be compiled out during production compiles.

##### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[dom\]** Changed `DOM.*()` factory methods that accepted a `java.util.List` to accept a
  `java.util.stream.Stream` instead. The aim was to discourage the creation of intermediate `java.util.List`
  instances when not needed. The change also removes the last direct JSNI dependency that was blocking
  a move to J2CL/GWT3.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Remove `JsUtil.asJsArray()` as it is no longer used from within the React4j library.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Revert the change in `v0.21`  that modified the `Component.componentDidConstruct()` lifecycle
  method to accept two parameters `props` and `context` and instead just use the helper methods.
