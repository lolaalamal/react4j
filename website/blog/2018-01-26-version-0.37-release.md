[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.36...v0.37)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[docs\]** Fixed documentation describing the dependency injection `Feature` enum values.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.44`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** React4j components must be abstract and must not be concrete. This is the inverse of the
  requirements in version `v0.36` and earlier. The reason is that it never makes sense to instantiate the React4j
  components directly as it is expected that only the enhanced subclass is instantiated. This change was also
  mandated by the move to a later version of Arez that requires certain methods to be abstract and thus required
  that Arez components were at least able to be abstract.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Move `react4j.annotations.ReactComponent.Feature` from being a static inner class to top-level
  class `react4j.annotations.Feature`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** The `componentDidConstruct()` and `componentWillMount()` lifecycle methods on
  `react4j.core.Component` have been merged into a `postConstruct()` lifecycle method that exists purely within
  the java component model without ever being invoked from the native react framework.
