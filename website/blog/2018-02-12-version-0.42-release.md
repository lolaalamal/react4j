Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[processor\]** The annotation processor now generates `[MyComponent]Builder` class that can be used to
  build the `ReactNode` instance for a component. The builder is constructed such that it mandates that the
  developer supply all required props, may supply optional props and must complete the build of the component
  with the `children` prop if present.

#### Changed
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.braincheck:braincheck` dependency to `1.4.0`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.51`.
