[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.45...v0.46)

Changes in this release:

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Remove support for the `componentWillUpdate` lifecycle method as ReactJS is deprecating
  the method in `16.3` and plans to remove it in `17.x`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Rename `@EventHandler` to `@Callback`.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[annotations\]** Added the `initCallbackContext` parameter to the `@Callback` annotation. This determines
  whether the annotation processor attempts to generate code that initializes the calling context of the callback
  or leaves that responsibility to the invoker. In practical terms, subclasses of the `ReactArezComponent` class
  will have callbacks annotated with an `@arez.annotations.Action` if the parameter is set to `ENABLED` or
  `AUTODETECT`. This resulted in the removal of the `@react4j.arez.NoAutoAction` annotation as it no longer
  provides any additional functionality.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[processor\]** Separate the enhanced component class `[MyComponent]_` into two classes. Move the
  implementation artifacts to a class named `React4j_[MyComponent]` but leave the code that is accessed by
  a developer in the `[MyComponent]_` helper class. The helper class only contains the callback helper static
  methods and if there is no `@Callback` methods defined on the component the helper class will not be generated.
  The developer should not access `React4j_[MyComponent]` as internal implementation details are not guaranteed
  to remain consistent over time.
