[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.46...v0.47)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Passed the `onStateUpdateComplete` callback parameter of the `Component.setState(...)` methods
  to the native javascript `setState(...)` method to ensure that the react runtime invoked the callback at the
  correct time.

##### Added
* **\[annotations\]** Introduced the `@State` annotation that can be used on abstract getter/setter method
  pairs on instances of `ReactComponent`. The annotation processor will implement the getter as an access from
  reacts state value and a scheduled update of reacts state value via `scheduleStateUpdate()`. In subclasses of
  `ReactArezComponent`, the `@State` annotated method is made observable. This resulted in the simplification
  of `react.core.Component` to remove the remaining generics and the removal of the `BaseState` class.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Default the `react4j.check_component_state_invariants` configuration to `true` in development build.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Annotate the `react4j.core.Component.SetStateCallback` interface with the `@FunctionalInterface`
  annotation.
