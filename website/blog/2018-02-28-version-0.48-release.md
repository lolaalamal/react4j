[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.47...v0.48)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[arez\]** Avoid invoking logic within `ReactArezComponent.storeArezDataAsState()` if the component has been
  disposed. This is possible when the component triggers it's own disposal from one of the relevant lifecycle
  callback methods.
* **\[arez\]** Gracefully handle scenario where a subclass of `ReactArezComponent` has been disposed but react
  has requested that the component render. This can occur if the code explicitly disposes the component or a
  `@Dependency` annotation has been used.

##### Added
* **\[dom\]** Expose the unstable `batchedUpdates` API as `ReactDOM.batchedUpdates(Procedure)` as it is useful
  to batch changes that are coming in from a network endpoint.
* **\[processor\]** In components extending `ReactArezComponent`, detect whether the return type of a `@Prop`
  annotated method is a Arez component and if it is then annotate it with `arez.annotations.Dependency`. This
  has the side-effect that if a component has a prop that is a disposed Arez component, then the component will
  be disposed.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.61`.
