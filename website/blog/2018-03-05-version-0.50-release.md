[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.49...v0.50)

Changes in this release:

##### Added
* **\[core\]** Add support for the `React.Fragment` node type introduced in React `v16.2.0` as described in
  the [fragments]()https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/11/28/react-v16.2.0-fragment-support.html) section of the
  ReactJS release nodes. This has been implemented by adding several overlay `React.createFragment(...)` methods.

#### Changed
* **\[core\]** Convert the `React.createElement(...,JsArray)` method from a native method to an overlay method
  to reduce size of generated code and add opportunities for optimization within the GWT compiler.
* **\[core\]** Change the `React.createElement(...,ReactNode[])` method to a varargs method.
