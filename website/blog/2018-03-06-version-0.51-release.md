[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.50...v0.51)

Changes in this release:

##### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Changed the way that `@Prop` annotated methods are generated so that the GWT compiler
  does not assume that all values are non-null and thus eliminate null checks from production code.

##### Added
* **\[core\]** Add the `React.isValidELement(ReactNode)` method that exposes the underlying ReactJS method.

##### Removed
* **\[core\]** Remove the `ReactElement` class as it no longer adds any value.
