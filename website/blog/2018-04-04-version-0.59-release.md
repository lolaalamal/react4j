[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.58...v0.59)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** Ensure that a react component with a parameterized type will add the parameterized type
  to the builder step interfaces to avoid compilation errors if the type parameter is used by the prop methods.
* **\[processor\]** The annotation processor will generate an error if dagger is enabled and the react component
  has type parameters as dagger is incapable of injecting such components using the technique employed by React4j.
