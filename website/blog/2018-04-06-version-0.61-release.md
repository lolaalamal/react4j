[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.60...v0.61)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[processor\]** The annotation processor would generate `@Prop` accessor implementations that explicitly cast
  a null to a primitive value, when accessing a prop that was not marked as `@Nonnull`. However primitive values
  can never be annotated with `@Nonnull` and thus all primitive methods included this methods, guaranteeing a
  NullPointerException and triggering errors in several static source code analysis tools such as Findbugs.
