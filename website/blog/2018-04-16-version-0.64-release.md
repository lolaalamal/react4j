[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.63...v0.64)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[arez\]** Avoid invoking `Component.scheduleRender(...)` from `ReactArezComponent.onRenderDepsChanged()`
  if the component is no longer bound. This can occur when the component has been removed from the DOM tree
  and has been scheduled for disposal but Arez has yet to complete the disposal. This scenario previously
  triggered an invariant failure in native react development library.

#### Added
* **\[core\]** Re-add the method `Component.isComponentBound()` that will return false after the
  `Component.componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method completes. This method should be avoided unless
  an asynchronous task can invoke `Component.scheduleStateUpdate(..)` or `Component.scheduleRender(...)`
   and the asynchronous tasks can not be easily aborted when the component is unmounted.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Avoid overriding `ReactArezComponent.componentWillUnmount()` and mandating that subclasses
  call the method in any overriding classes.
