[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.64...v0.65)

Changes in this release:

#### Fixed
* **\[core\]** Make sure that the native component invoked `Component.performComponentWillUnmount()`
  rather than `Component.componentWillUnmount()` to allow middleware the chance to decorate the
  lifecycle.

##### Added
* **\[processor\]** The types generated by the annotation processor are now associated with the
  annotated class and all it's supertypes as a originating elements. These are provided as hints
  to the tool infrastructure to better manage dependencies. In particular incremental compilation
  by IDEs can make use of this to trigger recompilation when necessary.

#### Removed
* **\[core\]** Removed the method `Component.isComponentBound()` as it was only valid if the component
  lifecycle method `Component.componentWillUnmount()` was specified in a component. While this was
  documented, it proved to be too confusing a feature to rely upon. The introduction of this feature
  in `v0.64` changed the behaviour of `ReactArezComponent` which meant that these components may not
  clean up arez elements and could receive callbacks after the components had been unmounted.

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.79`.
