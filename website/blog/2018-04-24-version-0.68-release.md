[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.67...v0.68)

Changes in this release:

#### Changed
* ðŸ’¥ **\[arez\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.80`.
* **\[processor\]** Change the way that the annotation processor marks generated classes as
  generated. When the source version of input code is Java 9 or greater then the
  `javax.annotation.processing.Generated` annotation is added rather than the historic
  `javax.annotation.Generated` which can be difficult to support in Java 9 due to split modules.
* **\[docs\]** Enable search on the website.
* **\[processor\]** Verify that methods annotated with `@Callback` are not abstract.
* **\[processor\]** Verify that methods annotated with `@Callback` are not static.
* **\[processor\]** Verify that methods annotated with `@Callback`, `@State` and `@Prop` are
  callable by subclasses. They must not be private and if they are package access then the methods
  must be defined in the same package as the class annotated with `@ReactComponent`
* **\[annotations\]** Document the requirements for `@Callback` annotated methods.
* **\[processor\]** Fix the error message emitted when the render method is not overridden.
