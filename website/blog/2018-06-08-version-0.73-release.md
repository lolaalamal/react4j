[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.72...v0.73)

Changes in this release:

* **\[dom\]** Enhanced `HtmlGlobalFields.className` so that it will filter out null className elements
  thus allowing you to adopt simpler mechanisms for defining attribute such as inline ternaries when some
  classes are optional. i.e. `new HtmlProps().className( "button", isActive() ? "active" : null )`
* **\[processor\]** Update the processor so it does not generate classes that require the
  `javax.annotation.Generated` be present on the class path. The classes will only be annotated with
  this annotation if it is present on the classpath at the time of generation and the source version
  is `8`.
* **\[processor\]** Enhance the annotation processor so that it will not attempt to process classes
  until they are completely resolved. If an React4j component contains a dependency on code with compilation
  errors or has a circular dependency with generated code then it will not able to be processed
  by the new annotation processor.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.90`.
