[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.73...v0.74)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Enhance the processor so that it does not generate the `deferScheduler` parameter on
  the `@ArezComponent` annotation if there are no `@Autorun` methods contained within the `ReactArezComponent`.
* Fixed a bug that allowed compiled javascript artifacts to be packaged inside the published jars.
