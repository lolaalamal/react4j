[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.76...v0.77)

Changes in this release:

* **\[gwt-output-qa\]** Upgrade the version of `gwt-symbolmap` to `0.08`.
* **\[gwt-output-qa\]** Cleanup dependency tree in `gwt-output-qa` to use transitive dependencies
  where applicable.
* **\[core\]** Add the `@JsConstructor` to the constructor of the `react4j.core.NativeComponent`
  class and to the constructors of all subclasses, including those generated by the annotation
  processor. This is to satisfy J2CL which has stricter requirements with respect to the jsinterop
  annotations.
