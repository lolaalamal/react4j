[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.77...v0.78)

Changes in this release:

* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.93`.
* **\[arez\]** Change the priority of the `ReactArezComponent.trackRender()` method to `LOW`
  so that component re-renders are always scheduled after other higher priority Arez reactions.
  This reduces the chance that a single component will be re-rendered multiple times within
  a single Arez reaction round.
