[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.78...v0.79)

Changes in this release:

* **\[dom\]** Explicitly specify the namespace and name for event types. This is required by J2CL.
* **\[dom\]** Move the javascript packaged in `react-dom` artifact from the `react4j.core.public`
  package to the `react4j.dom.public` package and updated the GWT module definition to retrieve
  resources from that package.
* **\[dom\]** Introduce the `react4j.dom.ReactDOMDev` GWT module that includes the debug source
  for the `react-dom` library. This is now needed as the dev source is no longer incidentally
  included when the `react4j.core.ReactDev` GWT module is incidentally included.
* **\[dom\]** Rename the `react4j.dom.ReactDOM` GWT module to `react4j.dom.Dom` and the
  `react4j.dom.ReactDOMDev` GWT module to `react4j.dom.DomDev` to follow existing conventions.
* **\[arez\]** Rename the GWT modules in the `react4j-arez` module to follow conventions (i.e. to
  be named the same as the package name) to follow existing conventions.
* **\[core\]** Rename the `react4j.core` package to `react4j`
