[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.79...v0.80)

Changes in this release:

* **\[arez\]** Stop annotating props with `@Dependency` if the prop type is annotated with
  `@ArezComponent` and the prop is on a sub-class of `react4j.arez.ReactArezComponent`. The
  `ReactArezComponent` has added an additional method `anyPropsDisposed()` that is overridden
  by the annotation processor when candidate props are present. The render method skips rendering
  if any prop is disposed.
* Update the javascript included within package to react version `16.4.1`.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.95`.
* **\[arez\]** If a render is triggered on a subclass of `react4j.arez.ReactArezComponent` and the
  render has no Arez dependencies then the code will now generate an invariant failure. Extending
  a `react4j.arez.ReactArezComponent` when it is not needed is an unnecessary overhead.
