[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.80...v0.81)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.braincheck:braincheck:jar` dependency to `1.11.0` for improved
  compatibility with J2CL with respect to compile-time constants.
* **\[processor\]** Change the jsinterop typing of the `Lifecycle` interface applied to native React4j
  components from `@JsType(isNative = true)` to `@JsType(isNative = true,namespace = JsPackage.GLOBAL,name = "?")`
  as that seems to be more inline with the code expected by J2CL or more precisely the closure compiler.
* **\[core\]** Move the native methods `ReactDOM.createElement(String,Props,...)` to the `React` class
  as `@JsMethod` and add `@JsOverlay` methods to `ReactDOM` that type them more specifically using types
  within the dom package. This results in a 1% size reduction under J2CL with no performance impact.
* Compile-time constants work differently between the JRE, J2CL and GWT2.x environments. Adopt an
  approach that has the same effective outcome across all environments. This involves using instance
  comparisons for results returned from `System.getProperty(...)` in GWT2.x and J2CL environments and
  using normal `equals()` method in JRE. It should be noted that for this to work correctly in the J2CL
  environment, the properties still need to defined via code such as:
  `/** @define {string} */ goog.define('react4j.environment', 'production');`
