[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.81...v0.82)

Changes in this release:

* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.96`.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez.browserlocation` dependency to version `0.23`.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez.spytools` dependency to version `0.20`.
* **\[core\]** Introduce JDepend based test that verifies that no unexpected dependencies between packages
  occur.
* ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** The `react4j-annotations` module has been merged into `react4j-core` as they are
  almost always used in combination. It was felt merging the modules simplified usage in downstream projects.
  JDepend is used to ensure that no undesired dependencies between packages are added now that the code is
  in a single module.
* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Move `react4j.RefConsumer` to `react4j.dom.proptypes.html.RefConsumer` and into the
  `react4j-dom` module from the `react4j-core` module.
