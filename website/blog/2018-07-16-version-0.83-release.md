[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.82...v0.83)

Changes in this release:

* **\[arez\]** Replace the jetbrains artifact with a J2CL compatible variant.
* **\[arez\]** Made the `ReactArezEnvironment.ReactReactionEnvironment` class final so that Arez can
  change the `ReactionEnvironment` interface into a `@JsFunction` in the future to eliminate some overhead.
* **\[processor\]** Enhance the generated subclasses of `react4j.arez.ReactArezComponent` to eliminate
  the `arez.annotations.Action` annotation on the `reportPropsChanged(...)` method if there is no props
  as the `@Action` annotation is not needed and will generate an invariant failure in Arez version `0.97+`.
* **\[processor\]** Fix a bug when overriding the `react4j.arez.ReactArezComponent.reportPropsChanged(...)`
  method in the generated component subclasses where the component has a prop named `"child"`. Changes are
  no propagated as the key was not translated to the correct key `"children"`.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.98`.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez.browserlocation` dependency to version `0.25`.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez.spytools` dependency to version `0.23`.
