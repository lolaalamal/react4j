[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.84...v0.85)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Avoid using synthetic parameter names in cached handlers and overridden methods
  when generating code to support the `@Callback` annotated methods. Instead use the names of the
  implementing method or the defining interface as appropriate. This produces more readable code
  and improves spy logging messages when the component is a subclass of `react4j.arez.ReactArezComponent`.
* **\[processor\]** Cleanup the method that creates the callback handler to avoid defining a local
  variable if it immediately returned.
* **\[core\]** Add the `@define` configuration for the compile-time constants that is required for the
  closure compiler to correctly process constants at compile time.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.braincheck:braincheck:jar` dependency to `1.12.0` to include
  closure defines for braincheck compile-time constants.
* **\[dom\]** Add invariant check to the `HtmlGlobalFields.className(...)` method that verifies the class
  name elements passed to the method are not empty and do not include leading or trailing whitespace. These
  scenarios typically mean the developer should be passing multiple parameters, some of which can be null
  if they are to be omitted.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.99`.
