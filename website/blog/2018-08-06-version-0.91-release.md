[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.90...v0.91)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Change the annotation processor to eliminate type checking in `@Prop` method
  implementation when `ReactConfig.shouldCheckInvariants()` return false. This also reduces code size.
