[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.91...v0.92)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Add the `disposable` parameter to `@Prop` that allows more explicit control over whether a
  prop needs to be checked in `isAnyPropDisposed()` to see if the prop is disposed prior to rendering
  the component.
