[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.97...v0.98)

Changes in this release:

* **\[arez\]** Fixed a bug in `ReactArezComponent` that could cause `react.js` to generate an error message
  indicating `setState()` or `forceRender()` was invoked from within the `render()` method of a component.
  This could occur where an event handler caused a change that resulted in a component re-rendering and ceasing
  to observe a component with `disposeOnDeactivate` set to `true`. The component would then dispose, potentially
  triggering changes and triggering re-rendering other components (via `setState()` or `forceRender()` ) from
  within the `render()` of the react component that un-observed the arez components. The fix was to pause the
  arez scheduler and re-enable it in a microtask following the render.
