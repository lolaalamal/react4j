[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.98...v0.99)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Generate a compile time error if a `@Prop` annotated method returns a boxed primitive and
  is annotated with `@Nonnull` annotation. The code should just use the primitive type.
* **\[processor\]** Generate a compile error if a component that does not extend `ReactArezComponent` has a field
  annotated with an arez annotation.
