[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.100...v0.101)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Fix a bug where primitive types that had a `@Nonnull` annotation were being
  incorrectly boxed as `Objects.requireNonNull(...)` was invoked on the value before being passed
  to prop setter. This resulted in the value being boxed prior to reaching the `@DoNotAutobox` method.
