[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.102...v0.103)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Remove the `Annotations.gwt.xml` gwt module and include source from `React.gwt.xml` gwt module.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.111`.
* **\[core\]** Remove the `@Callback` annotation. It encouraged poor practices such as using callbacks when not
  needed and often led to over use of `@Action` annotation for arez based react components.
