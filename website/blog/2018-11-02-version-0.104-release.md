[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.103...v0.104)

Changes in this release:

* Update the javascript included within package to react version `16.6.0`.
* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.112`.
* **\[processor\]** Change the way the Dagger2 factory is defined by switching from a static method using a
  `@Provide` annotation to using an abstract method using a `@Binds` annotation. This results in more optimized
  code being output by the dagger compiler.
* **\[arez\]** Set the `@Observe.reportResults` parameter to `false` for the `ReactArezComponent.trackRender()`
  method so that the result of rendering are not reported to the spy system. This eliminates a significant
  performance degradation that occurs when naive spy listeners serialize the results.
