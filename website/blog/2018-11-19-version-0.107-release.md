[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.106...v0.107)

Changes in this release:

* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.115`.
* **\[processor\]** Simplify the way that the provider is generated for dagger injection enabled components.
  This goal was to eliminate a level of indirection that was previously required due to the type parameters on the
  `react4j.Component` class. The indirection is still required if the component class is not public but can be
  eliminated when the component class is public and thus guaranteed to be accessible from the associated
  `DaggerComponent`.
