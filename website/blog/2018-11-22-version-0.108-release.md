[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.107...v0.108)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** The generated builder previously supported a `child(ReactNode)` method on components that
  supported multiple children. The `child(ReactNode)` supported accumulation of children over multiple
  invocations. This feature was not used in any downstream project and made certain optimizations difficult.
  This method is no longer generated. A method with the same function in `Context.Provider` class was also
  removed for the same reason.
* **\[core\]** Remove `react4j.Key` as the values is always converted to a string so convert at API layer.
* **\[processor\]** Refactor the annotation processor to directly create `ReactElement` instances. This
  reduces some memory overhead by:
  - eliminating the need to handle `key` as a prop for components.
  - eliminating the duplication of the props object.
  - inlining the setting of default props into component builder. This eliminated the need to set the static
    property `defaultProps` onto the component constructor function.
* **\[core\]** Remove the `React.createElement(...)` methods used for creating component `ReactElement`
  instances as they are no longer used anymore.
