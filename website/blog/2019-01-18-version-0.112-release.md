[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.111...v0.112)

Changes in this release:

* **\[processor\]** Extract the definition of the lifecycle methods from out of each of the generated
  component subclasses into interfaces such as `react4j.OnComponentDidMount`, `react4j.OnComponentDidUpdate`
  etc. The native implementations then implement each lifecycle interface as required rather than synthesizing
  a aggregate lifecycle definition custom to that component.
* **\[core\]** Simplify the `Component.storeDebugDataAsState()` to make it easier to identify when the debug
  state is updated.
* **\[core\]** Move internal classes used by the code generator to the `react4j.internal` package so that it
  is clear that they are not intended to be referenced by external code and may change between releases. The
  classes move include the classes named `react4j.On*`, `react4j.Native*` and `react4j.ComponentConstructorFunction`.
* **\[core\]** Move the method used used to access compile time configuration from the `ReactConfig` class to the
  `React` class and change the access level of `ReactConfig` to package access.
* **\[processor\]** Remove the `prevProps` parameter from the synthetic `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle method
  on the java component if it is unused.
* **\[processor\]** Improve the code generated for the synthetic `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method on
  the java component by eliminating unused local variables if unused.
