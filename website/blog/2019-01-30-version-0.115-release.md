[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.114...v0.115)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Improve the javadocs on the `ReactComponent.Type` enums to clarify when a component will be
  re-rendered.
* **\[processor\]** Generate an error if a `@Prop` has specified `immutable=true` and either
  `shouldUpdateOnChange=ENABLE` or `observable=ENABLE`.
* **\[processor\]** If a `@Prop` has specified `immutable=true` and `shouldUpdateOnChange=AUTODETECT` then
  resolve the `shouldUpdateOnChange` parameter to `DISABLE`.
* **\[processor\]** Implement the `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method for all components, even if
  they have no props or no props where `shouldUpdateOnChange` resolves to `ENABLE`. This is so that components
  have consistent behaviour regardless of whether they require a prop or not. This is more consistent
  behaviour but is a breaking change compared to version `0.114` that would re-render components with no
  props every time their container was re-rendered.
* **\[processor\]** Add missing type parameters in generated component class to avoid `unchecked` compiler warning.
* **\[dom\]** Add explicit cast in generated `DOM` factory to avoid varargs compiler warning.
* **\[processor\]** Add support for defining react components with constructors that take parameters. These
  parameters are injected into the component similarly to `@Inject` annotated fields.
