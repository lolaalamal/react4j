[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.116...v0.117)

Changes in this release:

* **\[core\]** Upgrade the `com.google.elemental2:*` libraries to version `1.0.0-b15-7a28038`
  released under groupId `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2`.
* **\[processor\]** Immutable `@Prop` methods were unable to identify props that implemented `Keyed`
  via implementing an interface that extended `Keyed`. This has been fixed by delegating the decision
  of whether a type is assignable to `Keyed` to the compiler.
* **\[processor\]** Add support for enum typed immutable props.
* **\[processor\]** Ensure that the render method allows zero dependencies in the scenario where the
  first disposable prop is disposed and thus render terminates without observing any dependencies.
