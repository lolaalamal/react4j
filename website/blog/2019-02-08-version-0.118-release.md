[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.117...v0.118)

Changes in this release:

* **\[arez\]** Update the `org.realityforge.arez` dependencies to version `0.128`.
* **\[processor\]** Changed the way that the annotation processor generates errors. Previously if an error was
  detected, it was reported as a fatal error and the annotation processor halted the compile after the current
  processing round. This made development painful where one annotation processor consumed artifacts produced by
  another annotation processor or used multiple processing rounds to generate the required source as many errors
  would be produced due to missing artifacts that were completely unrelated to the original problem. Within React4j
  this scenario was common if dagger injection was enabled and React4j generated artifacts that were expected to be
  passed into the dagger annotation processor. Due to limitations imposed by the annotation processor framework,
  issues need to be reported in the round in which they are generated to avoid omitting diagnostic information
  about the error such as source location *but* reporting the issue as an error terminates the annotation
  processing rounds. To work around these limitations, React4j now reports all issues as `MANDATORY_WARNING` issues
  and adds a flag so that on the last round an error is generated if any of the `MANDATORY_WARNING` issues were
  generated. This is not ideal but is the best outcome we could find within the current annotation processing
  framework.
