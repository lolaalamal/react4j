[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.119...v0.120)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `1.0.0-b17-6897368`.
* **\[processor\]** Fix the error message when a `type=TRACKING` component fails to access an arez
  dependency within the render method so that it makes sense with modern React4j.
* **\[dom\]** Remove methods from the `DOM` factory that have a parameter of type `java.util.List`
  as it was resulting in some very bad code in downstream systems. In particular it was too easy
  for developers to conditionally add elements to a list and then render the list. This resulted
  it React failing to identify nodes as identical if they did not specify a `key` field. This
  resulted in poorly performing code. Developers can still access similar functionality by invoking
  `.stream()` on the list if integration with lists is needed.
