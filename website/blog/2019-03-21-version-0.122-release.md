[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.121...v0.122)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.arez` artifacts to version `0.133`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `1.0.0-b20-bfe6e22`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.braincheck` artifact to version `1.13.0`.
* Start building `spritz` branch in `react4j-todomvc` as part of build and release cycle.
* **\[core\]** Correct the pom so dependencies are accurately recorded. This pom ceased to be
  accurate after the `jsinterop` and `elemental2` moved group ids and the `arez` dependency
  was added directly to the `react-core` module.
