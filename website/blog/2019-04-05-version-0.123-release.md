[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.122...v0.123)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.gir` artifact to version `0.08`.
* **\[core\]** Use `const` rather than `let` for module import to avoid closure compiler warning.
* **\[core\]** Improve the `react.externs.js` so that it generates no errors when closure compiler
  processes the file with ` --jscomp_error '*'` setting enabled.
