[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.125...v0.126)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `2.23`.
* Remove `{@inheritDoc}` as it only explicitly indicates that the default behaviour at the expense of significant visual clutter.
* Remove intrinsic prop named `key`. End-users can specify a immutable prop which will synthesize a key to be passed
  to react runtime.
* Rename `@PostRender` annotation to to `@PostMountOrUpdate`.
* Add `Keyed.getKey(Object)` utility method.
* Fix bug where a null value for a `@Prop(immutable=true)` that had a type that was `Keyed` could generate a null pointer at runtime.
* Extract props variable to optimize code generation when a key is synthesized from multiple `@Prop(immutable=true)` props.
* Insert casts to improve code optimization opportunities when a key is synthesized from immutable props.
* Optimize code generation when a component has multiple default values for props by extracting a variable.
