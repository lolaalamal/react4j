[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.131...v0.132)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `au.com.stocksoftware.idea.codestyle` artifact to version `1.14`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.braincheck` artifact to version `1.20.0`.
* Explicitly declare `gwt-user` dependency in core module rather than relying on automatic inclusion due to the presence of the gwt addon. Exclude to `gwt-user` dependency from the generated pom file so as not to include it in j2cl projects.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.arez` artifacts to version `0.142`.
