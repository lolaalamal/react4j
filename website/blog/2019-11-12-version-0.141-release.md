[Full Changelog](https://github.com/react4j/react4j/compare/v0.140...v0.141)

Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.com.google.elemental2` artifacts to version `2.27`. This is a backwards incompatible change that forces the usage of a modern version of GWT such as the unofficial `2.8.2-v20191108` release.
