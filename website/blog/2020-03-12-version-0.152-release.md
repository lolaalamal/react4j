Changes in this release:

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.braincheck` artifact to version `1.26.0`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.arez` artifacts to version `0.170`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.org.jetbrains.annotations` artifact to version `1.5.0`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.sting` artifacts to version `0.06`.
* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.proton` artifacts to version `0.41`.
* Remove the `@StingProvider` annotation on `@ReactComponent` as it does not make sense to explicitly add the authored component to a Sting injector when the component it ultimately includes is a factory for the component.
